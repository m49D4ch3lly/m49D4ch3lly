Hi there 👋 — I’m Dr Magda Chelly

I’m a cybersecurity and digital risk specialist with a global background, focused on helping organisations understand and manage cyber risk as a business, regulatory, and systemic issue — not just a technical one.

I am the Founder of RiskImmune, a cybersecurity risk intelligence company focused on third-party risk, digital resilience, and regulatory-driven cyber risk management. My work sits at the intersection of technology, governance, regulation, and operational resilience, with a strong emphasis on how cyber risk propagates across supply chains and ecosystems.

My research interests include cyber risk quantification, digital resilience, third-party and systemic risk, regulation-driven security (DORA, NIS2), and the evolving impact of AI on cyber risk.
You can find my academic publications on Google Scholar:

I have appeared in international media and documentaries discussing cybercrime and cyber risk, including The Dark Web documentary on Channel News Asia, with distributed broadcasts on Canal Plus (France) and ZDFinfo (Germany), as well as interviews on radio and television programmes across Europe and Asia.
